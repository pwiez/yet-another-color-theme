# yet-another-color-theme
This is a theme for VS Code I made with dark / light variations. Vibrant colors and a nice background to go easy on the eyes. I like saturated colors.

## Installation

For now, you can install this theme directly:

1.  Download the `.vsix` file in the Releases section of this repository.
2.  Open VS Code.
3.  Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
4.  Click the `...` (More Actions) menu in the Extensions sidebar.
5.  Select `Install from VSIX...` and choose the downloaded file.
6.  Reload VS Code when prompted.

## For Best Look

I'm a huge fan of ' **Monaspace Neon** '. They did a great job with this font and it looks great with this theme.
